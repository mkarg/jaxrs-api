=== Executor Services

Executor services can be used to submit asynchronous tasks for
execution. JAX-RSÂ applications can specify executor services while
building a `Client` instance. Two methods are provided in
`ClientBuilder` for this purpose, namely, `executorService` and
`scheduledExecutorService`.

In an environment that supports the Concurrency Utilities for Java EE
<<bib13>>, such as the Java EE Full Profile, implementations MUST use
`ManagedExecutorService` and `ManagedScheduledExecutorService`,
respectively. The reader is referred to the Javadoc of `ClientBuilder`
for more information about executor services.
