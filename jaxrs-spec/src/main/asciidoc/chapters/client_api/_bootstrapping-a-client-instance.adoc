=== Bootstrapping a Client Instance

An instance of `Client` is required to access a Web resource using the
Client API. The default instance of `Client` can be obtained by calling
`newClient` on `ClientBuilder`. `Client` instances can be configured
using methods inherited from `Configurable` as follows:

[source,java,numbered]
-------------
// Default instance of client
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();

// Additional configuration of default client
client.property("MyProperty", "MyValue")
    .register(MyProvider.class)
    .register(MyFeature.class);
-------------

See Chapter <<providers>> for more information on providers. Properties
are simply name-value pairs where the value is an arbitrary object.
Features are also providers and must implement the `Feature` interface;
they are useful for grouping sets of properties and providers (including
other features) that are logically related and must be enabled as a
unit.
