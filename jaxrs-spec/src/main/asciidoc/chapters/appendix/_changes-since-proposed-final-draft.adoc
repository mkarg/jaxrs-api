=== Changes Since Proposed Final Draft

* <<request_matching>>: Additional sort criteria so that templates
with explicit regexs are sorted ahead of those with the default.
* <<request_matching>>, <<determine_response_type>>,
<<declaring_provider_capabilities>> and <<context_media_type>>: Q-values not
used in `@Consumes` or `@Produces`.
* <<message_body_writer>>: Fixed algorithm to refer to
<<determine_response_type>> instead of restating it. Fixed status code
returned when the media type has been determined but an appropriate
message body writer cannot be located.
* Chapter <<runtimedelegate>>: Clarify that an implementation can supply
an alternate `RuntimeDelegate` API class.
