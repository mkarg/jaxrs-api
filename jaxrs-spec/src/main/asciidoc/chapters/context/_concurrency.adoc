[[concurrency]]
=== Concurrency

Context is specific to a particular request but instances of certain
JAX-RSÂ components (providers and resource classes with a lifecycle other
than per-request) may need to support multiple concurrent requests. When
injecting an instance of one of the types listed in
<<contexttypes>>, the instance supplied MUST be capable of selecting the
correct context for a particular request. Use of a thread-local proxy is
a common way to achieve this.
