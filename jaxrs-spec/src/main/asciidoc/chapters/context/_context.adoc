== Context

JAX-RSÂ provides facilities for obtaining and processing information
about the application deployment context and the context of individual
requests. Such information is available to `Application` subclasses (see
Section <<config>>), root resource classes (see Chapter <<resources>>), and
providers (see Chapter <<providers>>). This chapter describes these
facilities.
