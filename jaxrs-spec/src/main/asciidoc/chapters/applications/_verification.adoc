=== Verification

Specific application requirements are detailed throughout this
specification and the JAX-RS Javadocs. Implementations MAY perform
verification steps that go beyond what it is stated in this document.

A JAX-RS implementation MAY report an error condition if it detects that
two or more resources could result in an ambiguity during the execution
of the algorithm described <<request_matching>>. For example, if
two resource methods in the same resource class have identical (or even
intersecting) values in all the annotations that are relevant to the
algorithm described in that section. The exact set of verification steps
as well as the error reporting mechanism is implementation dependent.
