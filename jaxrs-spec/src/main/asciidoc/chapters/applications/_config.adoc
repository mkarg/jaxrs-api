=== Configuration

The resources and providers that make up a JAX-RSÂ application are
configured via an application-supplied subclass of `Application`. An
implementation MAY provide alternate mechanisms for locating resource
classes and providers (e.g. runtime class scanning) but use of
`Application` is the only portable means of configuration.
