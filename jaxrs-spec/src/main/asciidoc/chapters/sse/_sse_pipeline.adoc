=== Processing Pipeline

Connections from SSE clients are represented by injectable instances of
`SseEventSink`. There are some similarities between SSE and asynchronous
processing (see Chapter <<asynchronous_processing>>). Asynchronous
responses can be resumed at most once while an `SseEventSink` can be
used multiple times to stream individual events.

For compatibility purposes, implementations MUST initiate processing of
an SSE response when either the first message is sent or when the
resource method returns, whichever happens first. The initial SSE
response, which may only include the HTTP headers, is processed using
the standard JAX-RS pipeline as described in Appendix
<<processing_pipeline>>. Each subsequent SSE event may include a different
payload and thus require the use of a specific message body writer. Note
that since this use case differs slightly from the normal
JAX-RS pipeline, implementations SHOULD NOT call entity interceptors on
each individual event.footnote:[As a matter of fact, there is no API to
bind entity interceptors to individual SSE events.]
