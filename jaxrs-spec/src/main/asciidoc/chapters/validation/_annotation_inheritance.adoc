=== Annotation Inheritance

The rules for inheritance of constraint annotation are defined in
<<bib16>>. It is worth noting that these rules are incompatible
with those defined in <<annotationinheritance>>. Generally
speaking, constraint annotations in <<bib16>> are cumulative (can
be strengthen) across a given type hierarchy while JAX-RS annotations
are inherited or, overridden and ignored.

The goal of this specification is to enable validation of
JAX-RS resources by leveraging existing Bean Validation implementations.
Therefore, JAX-RS implementations MUST follow the constraint annotation
rules defined in <<bib16>>.
