== Validation

Validation is the process of verifying that some data obeys one or more
pre-defined constraints. The Bean Validation specification <<bib16>>
defines an API to validate Java Beans. This chapter describes how
JAX-RS provides native support for validating resource classes based on
the concepts presented in <<bib16>>. See <<bv_support>> for
more information on implementation requirements.
